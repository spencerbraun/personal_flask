tag: about

I am currently a grad student at Stanford working on a Master’s in Statistics. I’m a self-taught programmer, voracious reader, and fan of the outdoors. I'm a native New Yorker, but have tried life in DC, Philly, and now the Bay Area. I love reading Russian lit, monetary economics, biographies, and economic histories.

<br/>
Previously I worked at [Hudson River Trading](https://www.hudson-trading.com), a high-frequency algorithmic trading firm. I spent most of my time coding in Python automating different pieces of the broker-dealer, monitoring trading and performance, and managing interdepartmental projects. I started my working life at [Berkeley Research Group](https://www.thinkbrg.com), an expert-driven consulting firm.
